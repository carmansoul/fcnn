# fcnn
This is a Fourier Convolutional Neural Network for pitch identification. This was a passion project for determining whether octave equivalence has analogy to systematic confusion due to similar overtones. The FCNN trained well enough that the idea was ruled out. Confusion was mainly between close pitches, which is also intuitive.
